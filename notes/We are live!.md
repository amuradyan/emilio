I've successfully deployed emilio to [AWS EC2](http://3.250.217.118/?are%20you%20here?).

Emilio is online on Telegram /0 tests so far, 0 pipelines, just hacking/. The implementation is rather hasty and dirty. Now I'll spend some time, going through OpenAI's documentation, I've heard of Streams, and I need to understand my Thread management.
